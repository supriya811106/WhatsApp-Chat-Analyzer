25/03/2023, 10:09 pm - Supriya: One advantage of using methods is making efficient reuse of the code. What is another major advantage?

You will not need to nest methods within other methods.

Efficient code reuse prevents hacking.

A frequently used process can be modified by changing code in just one place.

Efficient code reuse prevents compilation errors.

You should limit coupling to reduce dependencies between classes.

You should increase coupling to improve dependencies between classes.

You should limit coupling so that class members relate to the class objective.
25/03/2023, 10:12 pm - Supriya: If a language just implements pass-by-value parameters to functions, can the objects passed as parameters be set to new instances inside the function and their new value will return to the caller?

No, a local copy will be initialized and will be lost as soon as it is out of scope.

Yes, since the value is a reference even though it is passed by value, it can be done.

No, you will get a compilation error.

Yes, but only if it is a reference and not a primitive class.

25/03/2023, 10:17 pm - Supriya: How do object behaviors and attributes differ?

Attributes describe a state; behaviors describe a change.

Behaviors describe dynamic properties; attributes are static.

Attributes apply only to a specified object; behaviors apply to other linked objects.

Behaviors are vector quantities; attributes are scalars.
25/03/2023, 11:13 pm - Supriya: A class template is a

blank superclass intended for inheritance and polymorphism

class that consists only of member variables, with no constructor, destructor, or member functions

class written with the generic programming paradigm, specifying behavior in terms of type parameters rather than specific types

skeleton source code for a class where the programmer has to fill in specific parts to define the data types and algorithms used
25/03/2023, 11:14 pm - Supriya: bool x=true, y=false;

if(~x || y){

/*part A*/

}

else{

/*part B*/

}

Part A executes because the expression (~x || y) always results in true if y== false.

Part B executes because ~x is false and y is false, thus the OR operation evaluates as false.

Part A executes because ~x is not zero, meaning true.

Part B executes because the statement (~x || y) is invalid, thus false.
25/03/2023, 11:16 pm - Supriya: What is a default constructor?

a constructor that initializes all members of a class

a constructor that is used by multiple classes

a constructor that does not have a return value

a constructor that can be used with no arguments

int anInt = new int(11);

int anInt = new int[11];

int* anInt = new int(11);
25/03/2023, 11:17 pm - Supriya: A class destructor can be called when a variety of situations occur. Which choice is not one of those situations?

An automatic storage duration object goes out of scope.

The garbage collector detects that an object is no longer going to be used.

The delete() function is called for an object pointer assigned with the new operator.

The program is terminated. This calls the destructor of static duration objects.

Tools

#include "library.h"

It cherry-picks library.h for the declarations and definitions of all data and functions used in the remainder of the source file main.cpp, finally replacing the #include directive by those declarations and definitions.

It causes the toolchain to compile all the contents of library.h so that its executable code is available when needed by the final application.

It informs the linker that some functions or data used in the source file main.cpp are contained in library.h, so that they can be called in run time. This is also known as dynamic linking.

It causes the replacement of the #include directive by the entire contents of the source file library.h. This is similar to a Copy-Paste operation of library.h into main.cpp.
25/03/2023, 11:23 pm - Supriya: What is an include guard?

a preprocessor statement that prevents a source file from being included more than once in a project

a library that adds safety features such as mutexes, watchdog timers, and assertions to the project
25/03/2023, 11:24 pm - Supriya: What is the operator and what does it do?

It is the same as the class member access operator, or arrow operator (->), which allows you to access a mel ber of an object through a pointer to the object.

It is a combination of the member access operator (.) and the dereference operator (*), so it allows you to access the object that a member pointer points to.

It is the member access with address-of operator, which returns the address of a class or struct member.

It is the pointer to member operator, and it allows you to access a member of an object through a pointer to that specific class

27/03/2023, 6:22 pm - Supriya: What is the primary difference between lists and tuples?

Lists are immutable, meaning you cannot change the data that is inside them once you have created the list. Tuples are mutable, meaning you can change the data that is inside them at any time.

Lists are mutable, meaning you can change the data that is inside them at any time. Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change the data that is inside them once you have created the tuple.

the tuple.

Lists can hold several data types inside them at once, but tuples can only hold the same data type if multiple elements are present.

25/08/2023, 10:29 pm - Supriya: Your Resume/CV is a key part of your Goldman Sachs application.  Therefore it's very important to build a successful Resume/CV that is well-written, clear and concise.  Based on our experience reviewing numerous applications, we have outlined some Resume/CV best practices and winning strategies below.

Format

The information on your Resume/CV should be as readable and aesthetically pleasing as possible with a measured balance between text and space
The standard length of a Resume/CV for a graduate application is one page.  Everything included in your Resume/CV should add value
Think about the points you consider particularly important.  Block capitals, different size fonts and bold or italic type can help to direct the reviewer's focus. Use with moderation and be consistent in your formatting
Avoid lengthy paragraphs; bullet points can be used to condense a list of details
Personal Details

Include your name, address, at least one email address, a home telephone number and a mobile telephone number
Be sure that all of your contact details are correct and up-to-date
Ensure that your e-mail address projects a professional image of yourself
Education Details

List your educational details in reverse order, with your most recent experiences first, back to your secondary level education
Integrate your education institutions and qualifications into one section
Highlight any positions of responsibility you may have held
Employment History/Work Experience

Especially if your career has been short to date, give details of all jobs and positions held.  Include part time and unpaid work, starting with your current or most recent employer
Work experience should not be limited to paid employment.  Include any volunteer work,  positions of responsibility within societies
This section can be used by reviewers to target your Resume/CV for particular positions at Goldman Sachs.   Use the experiences that you do have to talk about any relevant or transferable skills
Do not use valuable space to include the full addresses of your past employers
Personal Development/Skills

Write about any courses, societies, voluntary work or responsibilities you consider relevant
Sell any transferable or technical skills acquired
Before You Submit

Spell check!
Print out a copy and ask yourself the following questions:
     1. Will a recruiter find my Resume/CV easy to read and impactful?
     2. Is the content concise and effective?
     3. Is the application a good reflection of me and my experiences?
Ask a friend or colleague to read the document and ask them the same set of questions
28/08/2023, 5:49 pm - Supriya: You are given an array of non-negative integers, visits, which represents how many people visited a website on consecutive days, visits[0] is the number of visitors on the first day visits [1] is the number of visitor on the second day, and so on

Your task is to return the index of the first day when the total number of visits reaches a given target. In other words, visits[0] + visits[1]... visits[1] target if the sum of all daily visits never reaches the target, return -1

Note: You are not expected to provide the most optimal solution, but a solution with time complexity not worse than o(visits.length) will fit within the execution time limit

Example

• For visits = [300, 200, 100, 200, 500], and target = 700 the output should be solution (visits, target) J

Explanation:

The total number of visits at the end of the first day is 300, which is less than the given target = 700 The total number of visits at the end of the second day is 300 200 500 and 500 < 700

The total number of visits at the end of the third day is 300 200+ 100 600, and 600 < 700

The total number of visits at the end of the fourth day is 300+ 200 100 200 800, and 800> 700 The number of visits has exceeded the given target, so the answer

the index of that day: 3

• For visits = [900, 821, 1090], and target = 900 the output should be solution(visits, target) = 0

Explanation:

The number of visits at the end of the first day is 900, which is equal to target = 900, so the answer is o

• For visits - [700, 800, 500], and target 2001 the output should be solution (visits, target) - -1
28/08/2023, 5:52 pm - Supriya: Imagine that you are standing at the starting point of a straight street and are trying to reach the end of the street. This street is represented by a number line starting at and ending at Finial (finish > 0). There are electric scooters scattered along the street to help you get to the end. Specifically, the scooters are represented by an array scooters with scooters[1] representing the location of the 1th scooter. Each scooter can travel up to 10 points along the number line before its battery is fully discharged and it cannot go further. For example, if a scooter is tocated at point 5. it can travel to points 5. 6. 7. up to point 15 (inclusive), but it cannot get to point 16 or further

To get to the end point of the street, you must use the following algorithm

1. From the current position, travel to the nearest scooter to the right on foot. If there are no more scouters available, travel to the end point on foot.

2. Get on this scooter and use all of its battery/resources to travel as far as you can toward the end point

3. If you still haven't reached the end point, repeat this process from step 1

Given that you must use the algorithm described above to travel from the starting point of the street 0 to the end point of the street fintah your task is to return the total distance that you will

travel on foot.

Note: You are not expected to provide the most optimal solution, but a solution with time complexity not worse than ofscooters, length frotah) will fit within the execution time limit

Example

For finish 23 and scooters (7. 4, 14], the output should be solution (finish, scooters)=4

Starting at 0, you find the nearest scooter at point scooters [1] 4, so you move 4 points on foot to get there, and then use all of scooter's resources to get to point 14

There is another scooter at 14 (scooters [2] 14), which you use to get to the end point finish - 21

Therefore, you traveled only 4 points in total on foot

For finish - 27 and scooters [15, 7, 3, 10], the output should be solution (finish, scooters) = 7

Starting at point 0. you find the nearest scooter at point scooters [2] 3 so you move 3 points on foot to get there, and then use all of scooter's resources to get to port 11 From point 13, the nearest scooter to the right is at point scooters[0] 15, which takes 2 more points on foot and you reach point 25

There are no more scooters available to the right, so you travel 2 more points to the end point on foot

⚫Therefore, you traveled 3-2-2-7 points on foot
28/08/2023, 5:58 pm - Supriya: For finish 10 and scooters the output should be solution (finish, scooters) - 10 There are no scooters available along this street, so you must travel the whole route on foot, which is 10 points

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm eager to apply for the 2024 Summer Internship as a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co. I'm confident that my skills and experiences align well with the requirements of this position.

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Graphic Era University. During my studies, I've gained proficiency in programming languages like C, C++, and Python, along with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also worked with databases like MySQL and Oracle Database, and I'm comfortable using tools like Git and GitHub.

I've applied my knowledge in practical settings through internships. At The Designnovation Hub, I contributed as a Frontend Web Developer, where I collaborated with a team to create user-friendly web pages. During my internship at IEEE GEU Student Branch, I developed a garbage classification system using TensorFlow, achieving a 94% accuracy rate.

Additionally, I've completed personal projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis and web app development. My strong problem-solving abilities and experience in competitive coding contests further complement my technical skills.

I'm excited about the opportunity to learn and contribute to JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s software engineering team during the summer internship. I look forward to discussing how I can be a valuable asset to your organization.

Please feel free to reach me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address]. Thank you for considering my application.
